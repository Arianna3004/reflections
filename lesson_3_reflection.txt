-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  When you want to share you repository with other people in a simple mode.

-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because for example you might want to share some changes but not others.
