-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  When you want to share you repository with other people in a simple mode.

-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because for example you might want to share some changes but not others.
  
-Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

  Branches are different parts of a repository that contain different history of a file. Clone is a function that allows   you to copy a local repository in another local repository or copy a remote repository in a local repository. Fork       instead is a function that allows you to copy a remote repository directly in another remote repository.
